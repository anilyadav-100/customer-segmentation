# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This project involves customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies effectively. By grouping customers with similar characteristics, businesses can enhance their customer service, develop targeted campaigns, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Project Objectives
- To segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic data.
- To analyze and interpret the clusters to derive actionable insights.
- To visualize the segmentation results for easy understanding and presentation.


## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values, if any.
   - Normalizing the data for uniform scale.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understanding the distribution of features.
   - Identifying patterns and relationships between variables.

3. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Choosing the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
   - Applying the K-means algorithm to segment the customers.
   - Analyzing the characteristics of each cluster.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizing the clusters using 2D and 3D plots for better interpretation.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the K-means clustering algorithm.

## Results
- The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method.
- Customers were segmented into distinct groups based on their spending patterns and income levels.
- Visualizations provided insights into the characteristics of each customer segment, helping to identify high-value customers and potential areas for targeted marketing.
